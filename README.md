Docker Container for Penetration Testing
 - Will Include a lot of tools that are not known, but efficient. 


## To Do
- [ ] Add 5 tools for each section Before First Image
- [ ] Setup Docker Hub Repo 
- [ ] Setup up Module build for Each Section
- [ ] Add a fullset of security tools for each Section
- [ ] Map All Tools to MITRE-Attack Framework (Goal is to have a larger MITRE coverage then any other Docker Container or OS)
- [ ] Develop Custom Distro, which will be called `SneakAttack OS`
